Implementation of a graph data structure. The input consists of a set of vertices/nodes (V) 
and a set of edges (E) connecting pairs of vertices. Function incuded for generating both
adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of the graph. Also includes a function for
finding all possible paths between a pair of vertices via exhaustive search.
